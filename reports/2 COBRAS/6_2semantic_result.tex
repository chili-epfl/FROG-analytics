\subsection{Time interval selection}
Before selecting the best time interval we need to set two parameters: the threshold number of words in one \texttt{WindowOperation} and the threshold number of valid \texttt{WindowOperation} groups in one \texttt{Pad} (see Section \ref{sub:time_interval}). We set the minimum number of words to 10 according to the average length datasets STS2014-Forum (10.12 words), SICK2014 (9.67 words) \cite{sen2vec}. Also, in order to fit the similarity distribution we need enough similarity values in one \texttt{Pad}, so we set 5 as the minimum value of valid \texttt{WindowOperation} groups in a valid \texttt{Pad}. 
As we can see in Figure \ref{TimeInterval}, the candidate time intervals are from 60s to 380s. We chose 180s as it is the time interval with the most valid \texttt{Pads}.

\subsection{Semantic Analysis}
\label{sub:result_semantic}
Figure \ref{similar} shows the similarity value of three datasets. As we can see from those similarity values of each models for different similarity paragraph texts. \texttt{doc2vec} models can clearly recognize different similarity paragraph texts, but it has lower values even the the paragraph looks very similar and took the longest time to compute similarity. As for the fastest \texttt{spacy} model, it performed bad since the values of them are always very high even the two texts are totally different. And \texttt{sent2vec} model can correctly recognize them . Additionally, we can discover the different performances of those models when applying to same paragraph pair. \texttt{Spacy} model always have the highest values and  \texttt{doc2vec} always have the lowest values.  Overall, for each two paragraph pairs, the similarity difference(increase or decrease) between these two pairs are almost the same between different models. We finally chose \texttt{sent2vec} as our pre-trained model since it took less time and performed well in different similarity datasets.

    \end{figure}
    
\subsection{Fitting similarity distribution}
We could roughly separate our dataset into three categories depending on the trend of the semantic similarity distribution (increasing, stable and decreasing). However, at this point it is difficult to tell whether this classification would give us useful insights on the collaborative behavior  of the students.

Figure \ref{fitting} shows the similarity distribution of one valid \texttt{Pad}. We fitted a linear model to the observed data. From the Figure, we can easily see an increasing trend in topic similarity between this \texttt{Pad}'s authors, reflected in the positive slope of the fitted model.

\subsection{SuperParagraph similarity visualization}
When applying semantic analysis on \texttt{SuperParagraphs}, we first plot the heatmap for similarity values between all \texttt{SuperParagraphs} to get an overview of the document semantics. The heatmap in Figure \ref{similarity_heatmap} shows the inter \texttt{SuperParagraphs}' similarity in one document from our dataset.

We can conclude that \texttt{SuperParagraphs} 0 and 13 are the most different pair and \texttt{SuperParagraphs} 1 and 12 are the most similar pair. We include below the texts of those 4 \texttt{SuperParagraphs}, as it can be used to verify if we agree with the results and to get some intuition on how the results are computed:

\texttt{SuperParagraph 0}:\\
\textit{Your task is to act as an advisor to an official within the science  ministry. You are advising an official on the issues below. 
The official  is not an expert in the area, but you can assume they are a generally  informed reader.\\
They are interested in the best supported claims in the  documents. Produce a summary of the best supported claims you find and explain why you think they are.\\
Note you are not being asked to "create your own argument" or  "summarise everything you find" but rather, make a judgement about which  claims have the strongest support.}

\texttt{SuperParagraph 13}:\\
\textit{CONCLUSION:\\
Currently, glyphosate dominates crop weed control in soybean, maize,  canola and cotton in North and South America. Consequently, throughout  large areas, glyphosate reliance without diversity in weed control  practices is a strong selection pressure favoring the evolution and  eventual domination of glyphosate-resistant weed populations.}
\newpage
\texttt{SuperParagraph 1}:\\
\textit{INTRODUCTION :\\
Glyphosate  is the active ingredient in Roundup agricultural herbicides and other  herbicide formulations that are widely used for agricultural, forestry,  and residential weed control.\\
It is one of the most widely-used weedkillers in the  world, used by farmers, local government and gardeners, as well as  sprayed\\
extensively on some genetically modified crops imported into  Europe for use as animal feed.\\
Glyphosate,  N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine, is the most extensively used herbicide in  the history of agriculture. Weed management programs in glyphosate  resistant (GR) field crops have provided highly effective weed control,  simplified management decisions, and given cleaner harvested products}

\texttt{SuperParagraph 12}:\\
\textit{6.Glyphosate effects on diseases of plants\\
Glyphosate, N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine, is the most extensively used  herbicide in the history of agriculture. Weed management programs in  glyphosate resistant (GR) field crops have provided highly effective  weed control, simplified management decisions, and given cleaner  harvested products. However, this relatively simple, broad-spectrum,  systemic herbicide can have extensive unintended effects on nutrient  efficiency and disease severity, thereby threatening its agricultural sustainability.  Given that  recommended doses of glyphosate are often many times higher than needed  to control weeds, we believe the most prudent method to reduce the  detrimental effects of glyphosate on GR crops will be to use this  herbicide in as small a dose as practically needed. Such a frugal  approach will not only curtail disease predisposition of GR crops, but  will also benefit the grower and the 
environment.}

We also plotted the time evaluation of inter \texttt{Superparagraph} similarity. In Figure \ref{para_similarity}, each picture shows the evolution in time of the similarity between one \texttt{SuperParagraph} and all \texttt{SuperParagraphs}. The zero values at the beginning indicate that this \texttt{SuperParagraph} was not created yet.
