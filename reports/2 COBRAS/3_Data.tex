The data we use to test our tool consists of a group of pads written by first year Economics students. They took part in an approximately 45 minute long writing session and were asked to work in pairs to complete a task.

The Pads obtained from these sessions include some documents produced during a shorter \textit{warm-up} writing session and there are some Pads that were written by a single author. These Pads have not been considered when carrying out some parts of the analysis.
